# CPU power management — AMD Ryzen 5800X (Vermeer / Zen 3)

# Note:
# If you're not using the exact same processor as me, you can probably delete this entire file
# Or just use it for reference to configure your device. But don't just blindly copy it.
# Configured for maximum CPU performance with no power-saving features.
# - performance governor: EPP hints from the kernel tell amd_pstate to request the
#   highest frequency possible across all cores, minimizing any latency due to
#   frequency transitions.
# - processor.max_cstate=1 prevents C2, C3, and higher sleep states that could
#   cause wake-up latency spikes on idle cores.
# - cppc_prefctrl=1 enables platform-level preferred core support, letting the
#   hardware schedule to the fastest P-cores in a power-aware way.
# - amd_pstate is in active mode, which lets hardware directly control frequency
#   from EPP hints for lowest latency.

    # physically best cores for the workload. This should translate to higher
    # boost when single core is loaded.
    "amd_pstate.cppc_prefctrl=1"

    # Limit the maximum C-state to C1. This prevents the CPU from entering deeper
    # sleep states (C2, C3, etc.) which have a noticable wake-up latency. Keeping
    # cores in C1 instead of C6 eliminates that latency at the cost of higher
    # idle power consumption.

  # ── CPU frequency governor ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  # In amd_pstate=active mode, the scaling governor's frequency decisions are not
  # applied by hardware directly but translated into EPP hints. The performance
  # governor issues the highest EPP hint at all times.
  # This causes the maximum possible frequency to be requested for every task, maximizing
  # responsiveness at the cost of increased power draw and heat.
  powerManagement.cpuFreqGovernor = "performance";

  # ── EPP: Energy-Performance Preference ─────────────────────────────────────────
  #
  # On amd_pstate=active, EPP is the main knob that determines CPU frequency. EPP is set from
  # 0 (maximum performance) to 255 (maximum power savings).
  # power-profiles-daemon is NOT used; EPP is hard-coded to 0 (performance) to eliminate any
  # chance of profiles changing mid-session.
  #
  # amd_pstate EPP table:
  #   performance        = 0   (max freq always)
  #   balance_performance = 64  (somewhat balanced)
  #   balance_power      = 128  (balanced)
  #   power              = 192  (idle)
  #   power-save         = 255  (min freq)

  # systemd service to pin each CPU to maximum performance on boot and after resume.
  # - EPP=performance tells amd-pstate to always prefer the highest frequency.
  # - min=max=4600 MHz locks the frequency so no scaling decisions are made at all;
  #   this eliminates any latency from frequency transitions entirely.
  # - Because power-profiles-daemon is not running, this is the only thing setting EPP,
  #   so we handle both boot (wantedBy) and resume (ExecStopPost would be a hack;
  #   instead a full systemd resume hook could be added if needed).

  # power saving and locked max frequency, this becomes especially important.
